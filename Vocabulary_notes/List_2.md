## 1. rot

```
To rot is to decompose, or break down into smaller parts. When old food at the back of your refrigerator rots, you should throw it away.
Sometimes you can tell when something is beginning to rot because it smells bad. But the process that occurs when things rot is a natural one that you can see all around you as you walk through the woods or along the beach. Living organisms have to rot after they die, to make room for more organisms.
```

*Verb*

1. to decay by a gradual natural process, or to make something do this

   ```
   The trees were cut and left to rot.
   ```

   **rot away**

   ```

   ```

2. rot in hell/jail

   ```

## 2. flawed

```
Things that are flawed are less than perfect. A flawed dinner plate might have a small chip in it, and a flawed English paper includes at least one mistake.
Flawed objects have some kind of imperfection — a dent or a blemish. No one's perfect, so everyone is flawed in some way, but when this word describes a person it often means "weak in character."A Shakespearian flawed hero has some flaw or foible that will ultimately be his undoing: in other words, a "fatal flaw." Flawed comes from flaw, originally "a flake of snow," later "a splinter," and finally "an imperfection."
```

**fatally/fundamentally/deeply etc flawed**

```
The research behind this report is seriously flawed
The process and product of President Donald Trump’s policy on Afghanistan is deeply flawed
```

## 3. raze

```
Raze means to tear an object down to the ground. Before Donald Trump can raze that family's home to build another skyscraper, he's going to have to cut them a big check.
Raze is most often used to refer to knocking buildings down for construction projects, but it can also describe tearing down other objects. You can raze the sand dunes in order to make the beach perfectly flat. Raze comes from the word rasen, meaning "to scrape or erase," and it sounds similar to the word erase, which can help you remember its meaning. If you raze something, in a way it has been erased — it no longer exists in its previous form
```

```
Also under consideration is razing existing camps for the homeless, two officials said.
```

## 4. sequestered /səˈkwestəd/

```
a sequestered place is quiet and far away from people
```

## 5. vandalism /ˈvændəl-ɪzəm/

```
Vandalism is the destruction of someone else's property. Some people think of graffiti as public art, while others dismiss it as nothing but vandalism.
```

## 6. graffiti /ɡræˈfiːti/

```
Graffiti is a word, phrase, or image painted or drawn somewhere in public, like on the side of a building or on the walls in a restroom.
Art or vandalism? That’s the debate about graffiti. For some people, graffiti looks ugly and damages the property where it’s left. Others consider graffiti a form of self-expression and a celebration of public spaces. The word comes from the Italian graffito, which means “a scratch,” and like a deep scratch, graffiti can be difficult to remove. It’s also difficult to spell, but remember that there are two fs and only one t and you’ll get it right every time.
```

## 7. spurn

```
If you reject your mother's offer to buy you a pair of lederhosen with a snort and eye roll, you are spurning her generosity. To spurn means to reject with disdain.
Originally, to spurn was to kick away. Though it's not used in that context so often anymore, being spurned still feels like a kick in the gut. You can reject someone kindly, or let them down easily, but you can't spurn someone with anything but malice.
```

## 8. contingent /kənˈtɪndʒənt/

```
The adjective contingent can be used to describe when something can occur only when something else does first. Making money is contingent on finding a good-paying job.
When something is contingent it means that the possibility of an event or situation depends on another happening or being true first. For example, sometimes people want to buy a new house but they make the purchase of the house they want to buy contingent upon someone else buying their old house first. That way they don't end up owning two houses.
```

*Adjective*

**contingent on/upon**

```
Conservatives prefer a system where men's freedom is contingent on women's servitude.
```

*Noun*

a group of people who all have something in common, such as their nationality, beliefs etc, and who are part of a larger group

```

```

## 9. earmark

```
To earmark something is to set it aside for a specific purpose. If you’re saving money to spend it in a particular way — whether it’s for college or a fancy new pair of shoes — you have earmarked that money.
Originally, an earmark was a mark on the ear of an animal — such as a sheep — that indicated ownership. Similarly, when government officials earmark a resource, they're indicating what the resource will be used for. Earmarking is usually about money. $10,000 could be earmarked for cancer research. A grant could be earmarked for a children's hospital. Earmarking is a way of stating how something will be used.
```

## 10. combat

```
Combat is fighting between two groups of armed forces. When you engage in combat, typically this means you engage in fighting that involves weapons.
Combat comes from the Latin com- meaning "together with" and battere meaning "to fight." Combat can be used as a modifier; for example, a combat zone is an area where fighting is taking place. The word combat can also be used to refer to the action of fighting against something to prevent it. An after-school program for kids is working to combat the issue of street violence by creating a safe space where kids can go as an alternative.
```

## 11. scorch

```
To scorch is to burn something fiercely, to the point where its surface — your face, prairie grass, a steak on the grill — chars or otherwise changes color.
Although scorch usually refers to burning something (whether it's the sun or a blowtorch doing the burning), that's not always the case. An army can scorch an enemy territory — meaning raze everything in sight, without technically setting it on fire. Scorch can also mean to quickly overpower something or somebody, as in: "We're gonna scorch the other team tomorrow."
```

1. if you scorch something, or if it scorches, its surface burns slightly and changes colour

   ```
   The walls had been blackened and scorched by fire.
   ```

2. if strong heat scorches you, it burns you

   ```
   The hot sand scorched our feet.
   ```

3. to travel extremely fast

   **scorch along/down/across etc**

   ```
   He scorched out of the gate, almost crashing his new sports car.
   ```

## 12. tactic

```
Tactic is another word for maneuver or method. Looking for a way to get something done? Then you better find a tactic.
English-speakers have been talking about tactics since at least 1640, when this word was first recorded. A tactic is just a way to do something, a plan, or an approach. Generals have to have a good grasp on military tactics to win a battle; football teams have to use strong defensive tactics to keep the other guys from scoring. One time-tested tactic for winning over a teacher? Always turn your homework in on time!
```

```
a tactic employed to speed up the peace process
```

## 13. plight

```
A plight is a situation that's hard to get out of. Learning about the plight of very poor people trying to rebuild their homes after a devastating earthquake might inspire you to send money to a charity.
Plight means predicament. It comes from the word for pleat, which means fold. A plight is a tough bind. You'll usually hear the word plight for groups of people or animals struggling to survive, or struggling for better lives. We talk about the plight of refugees, or the plight of sea birds after an oil spill. An old-fashioned use of plight is for pledge. If you get engaged, you give a plight of your love.
```

```
The writer doesn’t want his reader to miss that the animal’s plight is no different from the migrant’s.
```

## 14. refugee /ˌrefjʊˈdʒiː/

```
A refugee is someone who has left a dangerous place for a less dangerous place. You could help refugees from a hurricane by bringing them food and blankets.
Refuge means shelter. So a refugee is a person that seeks shelter, usually from war, natural disaster, or some other harmful situation. If you see the conditions inside a refugee camp, you will realize how hard the lives of the refugees must have been before leaving home
```

## 15. refuge /ˈrefjuːdʒ/

```
To take refuge is to find a safe place. You might take refuge under a bridge in a hail storm, or in a basement during a tornado.
Refuge comes from a French word meaning "to flee," and, in most cases, a refuge is a place to flee to in order to get away from people or places that are unsafe. A refuge is a safe place, such as a building or even another country, as in "they sought refuge from the war by leaving their homeland," or it is a simple, personal place of comfort — like a friend's couch
```

1. [uncountable] shelter or protection from someone or something

   **take/seek refuge (in something)**

   ```

   ```

2. [countable] a place that provides shelter, or protection from danger

   ```

## 16. predicament /prɪˈdɪkəmənt/

```
If you're engaged to get married but suddenly fall in love with someone else, you have gotten yourself into quite a predicament. A predicament is a difficult, confusing, and unpleasant situation.
The Greek word that predicament originally descends from means "a state of being." Which makes sense considering the words that sound like predicate are all about states of being––predict, or say what's going to happen in the future, and predicate the second part of a sentence that's led by the verb. Think of predicament as an unpleasant state of being.
```

**in a predicament**

```
Other married couples are in a similar predicament.
```

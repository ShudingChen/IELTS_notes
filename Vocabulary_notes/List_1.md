A grain can also be a speck or a particle — the tiniest bit of something. Don't confuse this with another definition of grain, the kind you find in your bread — wheat, oats, alfalfa, and so on. Check out all the grains in the ten-grain bread next time you're in the bakery!

## 7. aggregate
```
It descends from aggregāre ("to cause to flock together" or "to join together"), a Latin verb made up of the prefix ad- (which means "to," and which usually changes to ag- before a g) and greg- or grex (meaning "flock, herd, or group").
Greg- also gave us congregate, gregarious, and segregate.
Aggregate is commonly employed in the phrase "in the aggregate," which means "considered as a whole."
Aggregate also has some specialized senses.
For example, it is used to describe a mass of minerals formed into a rock, and materials like sand or gravel that are used to form concrete, mortar, or plaster.
```
1. the total after a lot of different figures or points have been added together

   **aggregate of**

   ```

   ```

   **In the aggregate**

   ```
   In the aggregate (=as a group or in total), women outlive men by 7 or more years.
   ```

2. the whole amount

## 8. congregate

```
Congregate comes from Latin root words com, meaning "together" and gregare, meaning "to gather in a flock."
Congregation, or a gathering or assembly, comes from the same roots, as does gregarious, an adjective describing someone who likes to gather with others to socialize.
If you remember the key word is flock — what ministers often call their congregations — you should have no trouble remembering congregate means to flock together.
```

1. to come together in a group OPP disperse

   ```
   Crowds began to congregate to hear the President’s speech.
   ```

## 9. gregarious /ɡrɪˈɡeəriəs /

```
If you know someone who's outgoing, sociable, and fond of the company of others, you might want to call her gregarious.
The word was originally used to describe animals that live in flocks — it's from the Latin word grex, meaning "herd."
Not surprisingly, people began using it to describe humans who liked being in groups. 
Today biologists still speak of gregarious species, but you're more likely to hear it in reference to people.
Despite what you might suspect, it has no historical connection to the name Gregory — but if you know an outgoing fellow with that name, you could call him Greg-arious.

It can have a slightly negative connotation, and people are sometimes described as "overzealous," meaning they try too hard.
